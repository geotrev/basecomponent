UpgradedElement is a base class enabling modern component authoring techniques in custom elements.

Why should you use UpgradedElement?

1. Create dynamic, reactive components using modern web technology: Web Components!
2. Get all your favorite component authoring tools: state, properties, lifecycles.
3. It works in all modern browsers.

UpgradedElement extends the native web component functionality to provide more fine-tuned control over the element's lifecycle.

While it isn't absolutely required to know web components on a deep level, it wouldn't hurt to [read an overview](#using-custom-element-lifecycle-callbacks) to get the basics.

## Browser Support

UpgradedElement will work as-is in all major browsers, except IE11 and Opera Mini. The package won't include any polyfills on its own.

If you need to polyfill, here are the features worth including:

- [Symbols](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) (import via npm as `core-js/features/symbol`)
- [Web Components](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs)

## Goals

- **Intuitive API.** Provide an easy way to create a styled view in a shadow root and access useful lifecycle methods for modern, state-based component design.

- **Consistent expectations.** The API is designed to provide sensible default use-cases. Escape hatches are still provided for advanced control.

- **No magic.** My hope is that this custom element wrapper Just Works‚Ñ¢, and requires minimal effort to understand. That said, web components are fairly speculative despite being around for nearly a decade.
